Split given Chinese paragraphs into "words" and create a table.
One word for each row. Each "word" should be a small series of Hanji without
changing their meanings. Do not just split into each character if that changes
the meaning. Add pinyin,Â  both simplified and traditional hanji,
and English translation to each row.
Then, translate the whole paragraph into English.
Lastly, if there's any confusing parts to beginner Chinese learners, explain that.
Do not skip any characters.
